My name is Roger González, Computer engineer graduated in the "Universidad Tecnológica del Centro" in Valencia, Venezuela, and welcome to my webpage. I've been planning this proyect for almost 2 years! (quite a long time!).

My principal motive is to write about things that I like, like programming, code snipets, music, food, travels, basicly anything!

So **welcome**, make yourself at home.
