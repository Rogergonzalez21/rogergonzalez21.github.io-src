My name is Roger González, I am a Computer Engineer who graduated from "Universidad Tecnológica del Centro" in Valencia, Venezuela. Welcome to my webpage. I've been planning this project for almost 2 years now! (Quite a long time!).

My principal drive is to write about things that I like, such as programming, code snipets, music, food, travels, basically about anything and everything!

So **welcome**, make yourself at home.
